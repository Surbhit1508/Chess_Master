- **Keyboard**: Use arrow keys to navigate the board; press Enter to select or confirm moves.
- **Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the opposite end of the board, choose a piece for promotion using the keyboard.

## Game Rules

- **Pawn Promotion**: When a pawn reaches the eighth rank, it can be promoted to any other piece except a king.
- **Castling**: Castling involves the king and a rook. The king moves two squares towards the rook, and the rook moves to the square next to the king. Castling can only occur under specific conditions.
- **En Passant**: A special pawn capture that can happen when a pawn moves two squares forward from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn.
